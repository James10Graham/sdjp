            <p>Hello and welcome to the Shropshire DJ’s Podcast we are a bunch of guys that enjoy music and good laugh. We are based in the a county called Shropshire located in the UK. We are all in love with music and when we say we love music we love music! We like all genres of music and bulge out of our stereotypical box where you may suggest that we would only listen to one or two genres of music. You will find that this crew are invested in various types of music.</p>
            <p>In this collective we have two DJ’s, two producers and one avid music critique. This group of individuals created this podcast to show our musical diversity and we’re so confident in doing so that we did a podcast. We guarantee that you will have a varied music choice and music that you may have forgotten.</p>
            <p>The format of the show is somewhat unique and possibly one of its kind. We pick a genre or music style and try and battle it out over two rounds to see who has the best song choice. So give it a try find a genre of interest and see if we found the best track that meets the genre choice for that month.</p>
